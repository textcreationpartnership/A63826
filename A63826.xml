         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>Then had the Churches reſt throughout all Judea, and Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee, and Samaria, and were edified, and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the holy Ghoſt were multiplied.</q>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:38061:32"/> and preſſed; for the preſent I ſhall onely touch upon that, which this firſt part of the Text already handled, moſt directly points at.</p>
            <p>The ſum of all is in <hi>general,</hi> that if our Churches, through <hi>Gods</hi> mercy, have reſt in ſome kind and meaſure for the preſent, our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and care ſhould be that we may have it compleated, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, every way, and for ever, that in ſtead of that <hi>Surge Domine, &amp; diſſipentur inimici, Numb.</hi> 10. 35. when the Ark was wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the wilderneſs, we may ſay, <hi>Surge Domine in requiem tuam, Pſal.</hi> 132. 8. as it was then ſaid, when it was ſettled in the Temple; and that as here in the Text, the Churches in <hi>Judea, Galilee and Samaria,</hi> ſo that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py day may come, wherein <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland, and Ireland,</hi> may have their peace ſo ſettled, that they may be edified and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied.</p>

            <p>And there is great reaſon for it, Becauſe in all our jarrs and bloody conteſts with others, our quarel firſt began with a provoked <hi>God,</hi> and therefore our Atonement and Agreement ſhould begin there alſo.</p>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:38061:33"/> and intereſted; make we as fair weather either as we will or can here below, yet it will in the iſſue not prove fair weather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as long as Heaven frowne's, ſhowre's, and thunder's. If <hi>God</hi> indeed pleaſe to <hi>make peace in his high places,</hi> (as <hi>Bildads phraſe</hi> is, <hi>Job</hi> 25. 2.) then (as <hi>Elihu</hi> addes) <hi>If he give quietneſs, who can make trouble?</hi> But <hi>when he hideth his face, who then can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, whether it be done againſt a whole nation, or againſt a man onely, Job</hi> 34. 29.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we have peace without, (to make it compleat and laſting) labour we to have as much, or more peace within, that <hi>our luſts may not warre in our members;</hi>

            <p>In particular, <hi>Ceaſe from anger, and forſake wrath, and fret not thy ſelf in any wiſe to do evill;</hi> as
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:38061:33"/> the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> exhorteth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 8. Take heed of maintaining ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities, and of retaining old grudges, in remembrance of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or later injuries; for, the ſeas do not leave rowling, as ſoon as the winde leaves blowing; there may be <hi>great thoughts,</hi> and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of <hi>heart,</hi> when there are great overtures of renewed love, and friendſhip, which (if ſo) are but the skinning over of a cankred ſoare, which all that while eateth in deeper, and at laſt will break out, and then be more incurable; or like a ſmothered fire, which burnes more cruelly, and in the iſſue burſts out more violently, when once the train is laid, and takes like <hi>Abſoloms</hi> long conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſguiſing his malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his brother <hi>Amnon,</hi> till he could meet with a fit opportunity to diſcover it, and then he did it to purpoſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 20, 22. with 23. 24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. But the Church is the more ſlowly edified, not onely by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſuch enemies malice and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but alſo by other mens neglect through ſloath and ſelf-ſeeking: for with the returned Jews we are ſo eager on <hi>building of our own houſes,</hi> that mean while <note place="margin">Hag. 1. 2, 4.</note>

            <p>And deſire that all of us, even the beſt of us may be humbled for our remiſſeneſſe in ſetting upon, and carrying on this building up of the Church of Chriſt, which (as other Church-work is wont) go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on very ſlowly, and may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain

            <p>But better men in Scripture have written us a better copy. <hi>David</hi> now choſen to be King, and therefore had buſineſſe enough, with what ſpeed he could, to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle his own houſe, yet in the firſt place takes care of Gods, would not enter into his princely palace, nor lye down on his ſoft bed, nor <hi>ſleep,</hi> nay not ſo much as <hi>ſlumber, till he had found out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob, Pſal.</hi> 132. 3, 4, 5.

            <p>And afterward in <hi>Judahs</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>Babylon, Ezra</hi> layeth the foundations of the <hi>Temple,</hi> before <hi>Nehemiah</hi> raiſeth up the <hi>City</hi> walls: and truly if the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> would be firſt ſerved of the <hi>widow of Zareptahs</hi> proviſions, <note place="margin">1 King. 17. 13.</note> before her ſelf; is it fit that we ſhould ſerve our ſelves before our God? this is our Sin.</p>

            <p>We have already through Gods mercy ſome reſt, and therefore there is all reaſon that we ſhould now be edified according to the firſt reading.</p>
            <p>And again we have need to be edified, that ſo we may have our reſt confirmed, and our begun peace continued, according to the ſecond reading.</p>

In <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Rome, Janus</hi> his temple ſtood open onely in time of war, to ſue to their gods for peace, which they then wanted, moſt diſingenuous! like a man that openeth the door onely ſo far to his friend as to put out his hand to take in ſomething from him, which he ſtandeth in need of, and then to ſhut it upon him again.

But when ſhall we ſet about it, if not now? <hi>God</hi> hath given us <hi>Reſt,</hi> but not to be reſtive, reſt from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward trouble, that ſo we might be more expedite and ready thus to ſet upon his work, and ſo to work out our own ſalvation: Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Reſt,</hi> as there is a fit ſeaſon of it, ſo there is all reaſon that we ſhould labour to be edified, which was one Reading of the Words.</p>
            <p>And being edified, we ſhall <note place="margin">

            <p>That is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As the Apoſtles in the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:38061:64"/> courſe of their Miniſtry converted many to Chriſtianity: ſo more Churches were gathered in new places.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The former Churches in the ſame place were ſo increaſed by the converſion, and ſo acceſſion of new members, that not being well able to meet in one congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, for order ſake, and for their better edification, they were either divided into more Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in the ſame place, or as new <hi>Colonies</hi> were from them ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to ſtock and plant other places: and thus with the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Believers,</hi> the number al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of Churches was increaſed and multiplied.</p>
            <p>In the handling of this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, I ſhall endevour to make out theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That, as it is here recorded and reckoned, ſo indeed it is a very great bleſſing to have the Churches of <hi>God</hi> multiplied.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is an happy fruit and conſequent of their having peace, and being edified, for ſo they lie in the Text. Firſt <hi>they</hi> had <hi>reſt,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It is a very great bleſſing to have the Churches of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and multiplied, for as ſuch it is here recorded and reckoned: <hi>viz.</hi> As a 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> happy effect of their peace: Having reſt, they were both edified and multiplied: And for the further explaining of this particular, before the proof of it, I premiſe this double caution.</p>

            <p n="1">1. In the time of our reſt and peace we have great need to put forth the firſt A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. And as great cauſe we have Then alſo to put forth that ſecond Act of a Reverential obſervance of him as the greateſt and chiefeſt good, as having then ſtrongeſt ingagements layd upon us, and we thereby being put upon the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt

            <p>And yet (which is our both ſin and miſery) then we are moſt ſubject to do ſo, then as much, nay more then ever, to forget both our ſelves and him, and ſo by our ſins moſt bitterly to provoke him.

            <p n="2">2. So on the other the want of Gods fear hath theſe two undoing miſchiefs accompanying it.</p>

            <p>For otherwiſe moſt commonly in outward peace and proſperity we are ready to take comfort enough, and in ſome kindes and caſes too much, (as we ſhall ſee more afterward in the application) we are very ſubject to make an idol of it (as <hi>Iſrael</hi> delivered from <note place="margin">Exod. 32. 6</note>

            <p>And on the contrary how hard a thing is it, ſpiritually to rejoice in God, when we have many tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall delights to intertain us? as it is with a man to keep up his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and to taſte as much ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in his food, when he is uſed to a conſtant <hi>high</hi> feed, as he did when he was kept to ſhort pining commons.

            <p>There is a Tavern or more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> profane mirth, in drinking and

            <p>And the like we may ſay of all thoſe joyes and comforts which men take in any ſinfull wayes and practiſes; as in this kind <hi>Eſau com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted</hi> himſelf in his thoughts of revenge, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 42.

            <p n="1">1. For their Antiquity, as being <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bellarmine de Verbo Dei non Scripto, cap.</hi> 4.</note> before any Scripture was written; and therefore as firſt born muſt have the preheminence of primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hereupon in point of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity: as though the Church had
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:38061:146"/> more need of Traditions then of the Scriptures, and accordingly <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in that chapter (whoſe title is <hi>Oſtenditur Neceſſitas Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionum)</hi> in which he ſhould prove Traditions to be neceſſary, doth take a great deal of more pains to prove that the Scriptures are not neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In point of authority: which they ſay the Scripture hath onely from the Tradition of the Church, without which ſome of them are not afraid to ſay it would be of no more authority then <hi>Aeſops</hi> Fables: and the ſame <hi>Pighius</hi> who durſt call it a noſe of wax, when over ſhoos over boots, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore durſt go on and ſay, <hi>haec Scripta non praeeſſe noſtra religioni ſed ſubeſſe;</hi> and as <hi>Caranza</hi> adds, that the Scripture is to be regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Church, and not the Church by the Scripture.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In point of extent. Traditions according to them containing much more of the word and will of God, then the Scriptures: for although <hi>Andradius</hi> be ſo modeſt (and that is a wonder, for he is not uſually
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:38061:146"/> wont to be found in that fault) as to grant that <hi>maxima pars,</hi> the greateſt part of Gods revealed will is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Scripture, yet others of his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows cannot but account him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to have been over liberal; for on the quite contrary <hi>Hoſius</hi> ſaith, that <hi>multò maxima pars,</hi> that the greateſt part of it by far is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in <hi>Traditions,</hi> and others of them ſay that <hi>minima particula,</hi> it is the very leaſt part of all that is contained in Scripture, whileſt <hi>Traditio omnem veritatem in ſe habet,</hi> containeth all the myſteries of faith and Religion, if you will beleeve <hi>Coſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. For point of continuance. The ſame Author would have you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that this unwritten word is more ſafely kept in their hearts, and not to be raſed out of the Popes, their high Prieſts breaſt-plate, whileſt moths and worms may ſoon conſume theſe written papers and parchments.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And ſo alſo in point of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted certainty: whileſt the written word is but a dumb letter, ſpeaks not its own ſenſe, is a <hi>noſe</hi>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:38061:147"/> 
               <hi>of wax</hi> and leaden rule, which every heretick may bend to his purpoſe: on the contrary their <hi>Mufti,</hi> is a live Judge, and the Tradition of the Church is ſafely lockt up in his breaſt; he gives the true authentick ſenſe of it; and ſo preventeth both the Catholicks error, and the Hereticks deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In point of tranſcendent worth and uſefulneſs. The unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word is <hi>of more moment,</hi> ſay ſome of them, and <hi>multis parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſuperat ſcripturas,</hi> ſaith <hi>Coſter,</hi> as much as the <hi>fleſhly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> of Beleevers hearts (in which no doubt their Traditions are written) exceed the <hi>Tables of ſtone,</hi> or papers or parchments in which the Old and New Teſtament are written.</p>
            <p>And for uſe, <hi>Corn. à Lapide</hi> from thoſe words of the Covenant of Gods <hi>writing his Law in our hearts, Jer.</hi> 31. 33. would make ſuch weak men, and ſilly Novices as we are beleeve, that Traditions are more proper for the N.
